## About Our Project
The purpose of our project is to teach students about new technology while building something they can take with 
them and use in the future. In this project,the students will create a digital business card that holds information 
about themselves. The information they will provide is the courses they have taken, information about themselves, 
work and/or project experience, goals, and the social media platforms they would like to share with other people.
Once this is done, we will help the students link their digital business card to an NFC chip so they can share their
digtal business card with anyone they come across in the future. Our group is part of a program called Technology Ambassador Program (TAP). 
The goal of TAP is to use creative technologies to help inspire future students to pursue a career in IT. [Link to TAPs Home Page](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program/)
